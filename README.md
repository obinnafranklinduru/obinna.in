# obinna.in

This is my personal website. It is a simple and minimalistic website where I showcase my skills and projects as a developer. The design is inspired by [Kevin Clark](https://kevinclark.ca).

The application is built with **Next.js/React/TailwindCSS**

## Overview

- `Homepage/*` - A landing page for the visitor. This is what you will see when you land on the website.

- `About/*` - A brief intro that includes what I do, my technical skills, and my social links.

- `Experience/*` - A history of my work, my personal projects that I've undertaken, and my relevant projects.

- `Projects/*` - A grid of all the projects I have built.

- `Contact/*` - A form where the recruiter / end-user can reach out to me.
